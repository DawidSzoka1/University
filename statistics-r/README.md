# Statistics

## Course Description
This course focuses on fundamental concepts of probability and statistics, with applications in computational methods. It covers both theoretical and practical aspects, including data analysis, probability distributions, and statistical inference.

## Topics Covered
- **Random Variables** – Understanding discrete and continuous random variables.
- **Discrete Probability** – Probability mass functions, combinatorial probability.
- **Continuous Probability** – Probability density functions and cumulative distribution functions.
- **Probability Distributions** – Common distributions such as Binomial, Poisson, Normal, and Exponential.
- **Expected Value, Variance, and Standard Deviation** – Key statistical measures and their applications.
- **Stochastic Processes** – Introduction to Markov chains and time-dependent probabilistic models.
- **Sampling Methods** – Techniques for data collection and analysis.
- **Estimation** – Point and interval estimation, confidence intervals.
- **Hypothesis Testing** – Statistical tests, significance levels, and p-values.
- **Correlation and Regression** – Relationships between variables, linear regression models.
- **Computational Statistics** – Using R or other programming tools for statistical computations and simulations.

## Tools & Technologies
- **R Programming** – Primary language for statistical computing.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Understand and apply probability theory to real-world problems.
- Perform statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.
- Use computational tools to analyze and visualize data.
- Build predictive models using regression techniques.
- Interpret statistical results and make data-driven decisions.
